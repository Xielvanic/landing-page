# The context from file_context_0 suggests that there is an issue with a Git command related to symbolic references.
# However, this is not directly related to the .gitignore file.
# Since the .gitignore file is used to specify files and directories that should be ignored by Git,
# we should focus on adding relevant entries to ignore unnecessary files or directories.

# Based on the provided context, we can add the following entries to the .gitignore file:

# Ignore all log files
*.log

# Ignore the data directory where items.json is stored
data/

# Ignore any Python bytecode files
__pycache__/
*.pyc

# Ignore any temporary or backup files
*.tmp
*.bak

# Ignore any system-specific files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
